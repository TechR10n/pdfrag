\section{Introduction}

This documentation covers the PDF RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) System, a local system for building and querying a knowledge base from PDF documents.

\subsection{Overview}

The PDF RAG System allows users to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Upload PDF documents to create a knowledge base
\item Query the knowledge base using natural language
\item Receive accurate responses with citations to the source documents
\item Manage and update the knowledge base
\end{itemize}

This system is built using Flask for the web interface and MLflow for experiment tracking and model management.
