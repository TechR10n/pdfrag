# Introduction

This documentation covers the PDF RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) System, a local system for building and querying a knowledge base from PDF documents.

## Overview

The PDF RAG System allows users to:

1. Upload PDF documents to create a knowledge base
2. Query the knowledge base using natural language
3. Receive accurate responses with citations to the source documents
4. Manage and update the knowledge base

This system is built using Flask for the web interface and MLflow for experiment tracking and model management.
